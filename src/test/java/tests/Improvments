 Areas for Improvement
1.Handle options properly

    Right now, testSyncOperation ignores the options when calling syncLocalToGCS and syncGCSToLocal.
    We should make sure the options array is passed into the manager functions.

2.Improve failure assertions

    Instead of e.getMessage().contains(expectedError), we could use a more robust matching approach (e.g., regex or exact match).
    If GCS errors are structured (like JSON responses), we might want to parse and validate them properly.

3.Use logging instead of System.out.println (if applicable)

    If debugging is needed, it's better to use a logger (like Log4j or SLF4J) instead of printing directly to the console.

4.More granular failure scenarios

    We currently group all negative cases into one syncFailureData provider.
    If we separate different failure types into multiple DataProviders (e.g., "permission errors", "invalid paths"), debugging could be easier.

5.General consistency improvements

    Rename testSyncFromInvalidSource to testSyncFailure for clarity.
    Remove redundant comments where the function name is already clear.
